I am Yashwant Gadhave, a Computer Science graduate from Arizona State University, where I earned my bachelors degree with Summa Cum Laude honors and maintained a GPA of 3.96/4.00. I bring a strong foundation in full-stack development, backend engineering and data-driven systems, complemented by hands-on experience from academic, internship and teaching roles. As a Software Engineering Intern at Tech Diversified, I designed scalable authentication systems, optimized UI/UX components and managed backend data using tools like Docker, MySQL, and Elasticsearch. At ASU, I also served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant across courses in software engineering, cybersecurity, and digital design, mentoring over 150 students and reinforcing best practices in clean code, debugging, and object-oriented design. With expertise in JavaScript, Java, Python, SQL, and tools like AWS, Docker, Spark, and RESTful APIs, I am passionate about solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and scalable code. My work is driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a desire to contribute meaningfully to impactful software systems.
