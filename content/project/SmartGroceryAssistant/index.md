Smart Grocery Assistant is an intelligent pantry management web application designed to streamline household grocery tracking and reduce food waste. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**, the platform offers a modern and responsive interface for users to manage pantry items, set expiry reminders, and generate optimized shopping lists.

The project integrates **AI-powered OCR (via Tesseract.js)** to recognize text from receipts, automatically updating the pantry inventory. Real-time updates are achieved using API routes, JWT-based authentication, and dynamic front-end components built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. Interactive dashboards, implemented with **D3.js**, provide data visualizations such as consumption trends, category-based breakdowns, and expiry statistics.

Key features include:
- **Pantry Inventory Tracking** with automated expiry alerts and quantity monitoring.
- **AI-Powered Receipt Scanning** for seamless item entry.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations** (bar and pie charts) for tracking usage patterns.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility** with responsive design and mobile-friendly UI.
- **Secure Authentication** using JWT tokens and role-based access controls.

Future enhancements include integrating recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, voice assistant features for hands-free inventory updates, and a collaborative family mode for shared lists. This project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, AI integration, and user-centric application design.
